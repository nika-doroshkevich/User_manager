### Task :pencil2:

- Develop a Web application that allows users to register and authenticate.
- Unauthenticated users do not have access to user management (they can only access the registration form or authentication form).
- Authenticated users see the "users" table (ID, name, soap, registration date, last login date, status) with users.
- The table in the left column contains checkboxes for multiple selection, in the column header there is a check box "select all/deselect".
- Above the toolbar table with actions: Block, Unblock, Delete.
- The user can delete or block himself â€” at the same time, he must be logged out immediately.
- If someone else blocks or deletes the user, then at any next action the user is redirected to the login page.
- When registering, it should be possible to use any password, even from a single character.
- The blocked user cannot log in, the deleted user can re-register.
